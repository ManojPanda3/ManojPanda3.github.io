          After facing challenges with JEE Mains in May 2024, I embarked on a
          coding journey fueled by a passion for learning. I started with{' '}
          <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>React</b>, captivated by the world of web
          development. As AI trends gained momentum, my interest intensified,
          and I delved into <b>Python</b> and its ecosystem, mastering
          libraries like <b>Scikit-learn</b>, <b>NumPy</b>, <b>Pandas</b>, and{' '}
          <b>TensorFlow</b>. My college curriculum also provided a foundation
          in <b>C</b>, and I continue to expand my skills. Coding, for me, is an
          immersive and beautiful world.
