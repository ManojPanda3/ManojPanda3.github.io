          <i style="text-wrap:balance;margin:0px;padding-left:11rem;">After failing JEE Mains in May 2024,
            I started my coding journey with a passion for learning.
            I started with <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>React</b>, fascinated by the world of web development.
            As AI trends gained momentum, my interest peaked, and I delved into <b>Python</b> and its ecosystem, learning libraries like
            <b> Scikit-learn,</b>
            <b> NumPy,</b>
            <b> Pandas,</b>
            and
            <b> TensorFlow.</b>
            I also learned <b>C </b>from my college curriculum and continue to explore and enhance my skills.
            Coding is like a beautiful world, where I completely immerse myself whenever I do it.
